Stoke Lyne is a picturesque, quiet village nestling within the Shelswell parishes that lie between the old market towns of Brackley, Bicester and Buckingham. Visitors are attracted to Stoke Lyne as it is surrounded by beautiful countryside and the walks and views are spectacular. The parish lies mostly on the Great Oolite belt which crosses the county, and is close to the Cotswolds and the city of Oxford.
