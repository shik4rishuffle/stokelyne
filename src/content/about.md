This geographically large parish stretches from the Ockley Brook on the county boundary with Northamptonshire in the north, to Bainton in the south, and from Hethe Brede Farm in the east to the B430 by Ardley in the west. The landscape has changed in recent years. The M40 junction 10 is on the Ardley boundary. Nearby the Woodland Trust administers Stoke Wood which was formerly part of the Peyton estate. This has a car park and various walks, and is across the B4100 from the Stoke Lyne junction.
The parish includes several farms, a service station at Baynards Green on the B4100 Banbury road, the Peyton Arms public house and housing, farmland and several small woods. The land on which a small primary school stood until 1985 has been redeveloped at St Peter's Close, an area of detached houses. Bicester, together with Bicester Village Retail Centre, lies to the south just 4 miles away and Oxford is 14 miles, Banbury 10 miles to the northwest, and Brackley 7 miles away. Milton Keynes and Aylesbury are northeast and east respectively, each about 23 miles distant.<br />
At the centre of the parish is the village of Stoke Lyne with the church of St Peter. The parish itself is one of ten parishes grouped together as one benefice, the Shelswell Group. It is part of the Bicester and Islip Deanery, which is in turn part of the Oxford Diocese
The Church has a kitchen and toilets and the construction of a folding screen across the nave, which allows the west end to be used as a meeting room when required - the Parish Meeting Room which is available for hire.
Main village events may include the annual Fun Day held on the patronal festival day in June, the harvest service and supper and the senior citizens' party. <br />

### SCHOOLS

There are playgroups in the surrounding villages.<br />
