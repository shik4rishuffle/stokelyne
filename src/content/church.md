Dating from the 12th century, a statue - presumably of St Peter - can be seen above the main south door. 
In 1993 the west end of the church was tastefully re-designed to provide the parish with a meeting room and kitchen facilities.<br />
The vicarage, now a private house and known as 'The Old Rectory', was built in 1872. It has seen many vicars, but none so infamous as the Rev William Bryant MA who used to walk around the church tower, calling his parishioners to worship. He shot himself, in the vicarage, in 1914. His burial on 3rd November 1914 took place without the services of the Church of England.
St Peter's Church of Stoke Lyne dates back to the 14th Century and is architecturally beautiful inside and out, well worth a lingering pause.
