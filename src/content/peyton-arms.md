Situated in a rural farming community, within easy reach of junction 10 of the M40, this pub has no hand-pumps - 2 local Hook Norton Brewery ales are served direct from the cask. The hosts are local legends, very much a part of the character of the pub. A good old-fashioned hostelry for great conversation in a warm, friendly environment, the bar is adults only - but children are welcome in the garden. No food but simple rolls are available. Phone ahead for weekday opening hours.

Beautifully situated and largely unspoilt one-room stone-built alehouse, character landlord (Mick the Hat) and loyal regulars, very well kept Hook Norton from casks behind small corner bar, filled rolls, inglenook fire, tiled floor and lots of memorabilia, games area with darts and pool; no children or dogs; pleasant garden with Aunt Sally. Open all day Sat, closed Sun evening.

### History
Formed from two early 19th century stone properties and originally a village shop and simple, unspoilt bar. It was sold to Hook Norton in 1954 by the Peyton estate and the modest bar counter in the small main bar in the middle of the pub was probably fitted up very shortly after that. There are a few old shelves for a bar back, old stone fireplace, bench and window seating. In the distant past there was a small wooden partial partition to create a small snug/booth area to the right as you entered the main bar room. There is a small room to the left of the main bar i.e. at the front of the building. It was originally the private lounge when the pub was run for fifty years by two sisters, with only occasional public use. Nowadays it is in pub use, and has a large stone fireplace and service via a stable door. The beer and lager is fetched from the cellar situated between the two rooms which is not much bigger than a passage.
